""" SELECTION SORT
Another sorting algorithm we never covered in-depth is called "selection sort". 
It's similar to bubble sort in that it works by repeatedly swapping items in a list. 
However, it's slightly more efficient than bubble sort because it only makes one swap per iteration.

Selection sort pseudocode:

For each index:
Set smallest_idx to the current index
For each index from smallest_idx+1 to the end of the list:
If the number at the inner index is smaller than the number at smallest_idx, set smallest_idx to the inner index
Swap the number at the current index with the number at smallest_idx
ASSIGNMENT
Complete the selection_sort function.

It should sort the input list nums in ascending order using the selection sort algorithm. 
The function should then return the sorted list """
def selection_sort(nums):
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        smallest_idx = i
        for j in range(smallest_idx + 1, len(nums)):
            if nums[j] < nums[smallest_idx]:
                smallest_idx = j
        nums[i], nums[smallest_idx] = nums[smallest_idx], nums[i]
    return nums
